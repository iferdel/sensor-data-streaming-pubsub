Question	Interpretation
High shared_blks_written, low exec_writes	PostgreSQL dirtied many pages, but they weren’t flushed to disk (yet) — maybe coalesced later
Low shared_blks_written, high exec_writes	Disk writes came from WAL, background writer, or other backends, not directly from query buffer evictions
Both high	Query workload is flushing dirty pages aggressively and it's hitting disk quickly
Both low	System is mostly idle or reads only, or WAL/buffer management is effective
